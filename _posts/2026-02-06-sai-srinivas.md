My Internship Experience with VLED Lab – Pinternship Journey
I recently completed the VIBE phase of my internship, and I’m happy to share that I finished it 100%. This internship has been a very good learning experience for me.
At the beginning, I had many doubts and questions. But step by step, through the activities and guidance, I started understanding concepts more clearly. Each task helped me improve my thinking and problem-solving skills. I enjoyed the process of learning by doing.
What I liked most about this internship is that it focused on real learning instead of just theory. It encouraged me to explore, reflect, and grow at my own pace. The experience gave me more confidence to take on new challenges.
Now I’m excited to start the case studies and continue this journey. I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn with VLED Lab and IIT Ropar.
Looking forward to the next phase of learning and growth.
