When I joined the Pinternship with VLED Lab, I honestly didn’t know what to expect. Like many internships, I assumed it would be about completing tasks and ticking boxes. But very early on, I realized this journey was different. It wasn’t just about learning code — it was about learning how to learn.

At the beginning, everything felt overwhelming. The MERN stack sessions on ViBe were hands-on, and that was both exciting and challenging. There were moments when errors appeared on the screen and I didn’t even know where to start fixing them. Earlier, I used to think making mistakes meant I wasn’t good enough. Here, mistakes became part of the learning process.

One thing that stood out to me was consistency. This internship didn’t reward speed; it rewarded showing up every day and trying again. Case studies pushed me to think instead of memorizing. Breakout room discussions helped me realize that everyone struggles — the difference is whether we stop or continue.

There were days when I felt stuck, confused, and unsure of myself. But slowly, something changed. I started understanding errors instead of fearing them. I began asking better questions. I learned to break problems into smaller parts. More importantly, I became comfortable with not knowing everything immediately.

This internship also changed how I view learning. In college, learning often feels like rushing to finish the syllabus. Here, learning felt intentional. Feedback mattered. Reflection mattered. Even silence in thinking mattered.
